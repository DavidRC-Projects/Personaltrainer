# Personal Trainer webpage

## Introduction

The primary purpose of this webpage is to serve as a platform for my friends personal training business. My frined does not have a webpage and builds his client base from word of mouth. My aim is to provide an engaging and informnative introduction to his qualifications, experience and training philosophy. The site will also include details about one-on-one training sessions, nutritional guidance and customised workout plans tailored to the clients fitness goals. The webpage will include a booking system and accessable contact options for reaching out and asking questions and to make the process of booking a consultation easy and straight forward.
